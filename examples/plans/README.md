# Example Plans

Real-world implementation plans generated by Claude Code's plan mode, anonymized for public sharing.

**These plans were generated by Claude Code (Opus-level reasoning) — not hand-written by humans.**

The quality you see here is why Plan Stack works: AI can now produce plans worth reviewing.

These examples demonstrate how AI-generated plans can serve as documentation that:
- Guides implementation with clear, actionable steps
- Enables effective code review by providing context
- Builds institutional knowledge that compounds over time

## Plans

| Plan | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [20241218_staff_message_feature](./20241218_staff_message_feature.md) | New Feature | Multi-phase feature with new table, model, and UI. Includes ER diagrams and phased rollout. |
| [20241220_subscription_coupon_association](./20241220_subscription_coupon_association.md) | Data Model | Join table design with automatic data propagation on order creation. |
| [20241220_signup_profile_address_selection](./20241220_signup_profile_address_selection.md) | Frontend | Adding options to multiple similar React screens with shared component extraction. |
| [20241228_admin_search_cache](./20241228_admin_search_cache.md) | Cross-cutting | Redis-based search condition caching as opt-in Rails concern. |

## What Makes a Good Plan

These examples share common characteristics:

1. **Current State Analysis** - Understanding existing code before proposing changes
2. **Clear Scope** - Explicit "in scope" and "out of scope" boundaries
3. **File-level Specificity** - Exact files to modify, with line numbers when helpful
4. **Decision Documentation** - Why this approach over alternatives
5. **Test Cases** - Expected behavior in table format
6. **Open Questions** - Items needing clarification before implementation

## Note on Anonymization

These plans have been anonymized from a real production codebase (500+ tables, 300k+ lines):
- Domain-specific terms replaced with generic equivalents
- Company-specific references removed
- Code structure and patterns preserved for educational value
